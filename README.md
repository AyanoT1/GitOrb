# Git Orb

A no BS, minimal GitHub Dashboard to get work done. No Copilot, no feed, just your repos, issues, PRs and starred repos, one click away.

## Why

I was tired of having to have to click 2 times just to see my starred repos, having my repos displayed as a tiny ahh list for the left, and have 3/4'ths of my screen filled with AI slop and shi I don't care about. So I made my own GitHub Dashboard page using SvelteKit and Bun bc I wanted to try them out.

## Installation and Use

Since this is a 1-day project, I wont put this up in a server, local-first is more than enough for this.

- To set this up for yourself too, fork this repo if you want to make any chanes, set up OAuth in your account to access GitHub's API and place your API Keys in a `.env` file in the root of the repository.

- Install bun

- Clone the repo

- Run `bun install`

- Run `bun run dev` or `bun run build` then `bun run preview`

- Put it into your home server and done~!
